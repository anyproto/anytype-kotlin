Any Source Available License 1.0

This license contains the terms and conditions under which Any Association 
makes available its Software. Your use of the Software is subject to these 
terms and conditions. 

Any Association grants you (“Licensee”) a license to use, modify, and 
redistribute the Software, but only 
(a) for Non-Commercial Use, or (b) for Commercial Use in Allowed Networks.

If Licensee makes available a copy of the Software to any third party, 
the Software must be subject to the terms of this license only, and Licensee 
must provide a copy of this license to that third party. 
If Licensee makes changes or additions to the Software, Licensee may license 
those changes or additions under terms of your choice, but Licensee cannot 
change the license for the Software.

These terms do not allow Licensee to sublicense or transfer any of Licensee’s 
rights to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses not 
expressly granted in this license.

If Licensee violates any of these terms, or uses the Software in a way not 
authorized under this license, the license granted to Licensee ends 
immediately. 
If Licensee makes, or authorizes any other person to make, any written claim 
that the Software, or any other Any Association Product, infringes or 
contributes to infringement of any patent, all rights granted to Licensee 
under this license end immediately. 

As far as the law allows, the Software is provided AS IS, 
without any warranty or condition, and Any Association will not be liable 
to Licensee for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature 
of the Software, under any kind of legal claim.

Terms in this license are used as follows:

A “Any Association Product” is any product or service offered by 
Any Association or its affiliates. 

“Non-Commercial Use” means personal, academic, scientific, or research and 
development use, or evaluating the Software, but does not include uses where 
the Software facilitates any transaction of economic value other than on 
Allowed Networks. 

Any use that is not a Non-Commercial Use is a “Commercial Use.”

“Allowed Networks” (https://networks.any.coop) are the networks, 
identified by their unique ids, names, or list of nodes, that are expressly 
authorized by Any Association, to which the Software may send requests. 
Any Association may add networks to this list, and, upon reasonable notice, 
remove networks from it.

To “use” means any use, modification, distribution or other exploitation of 
the Software or any part of it.
