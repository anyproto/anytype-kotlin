# Anytype

Official Anytype client for Android.

## Build project

### Prerequisites

- Clone this repository
  
- Create `github.properties` file in root project folder:

    ```
    gpr.usr=GITHUB_USER_ID
    gpr.key=GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
    ```

Your Github ID (starting with '#' character) can be found [here](https://caius.github.io/github_id/). As to your personal Github access token, you can generate it in `Developer settings` in your profile settings on Github. 

- Create `apikeys.properties` file in root project folder:

    ```
    amplitude.debug="AMPLITUDE_DEBUG_KEY"
    amplitude.release="AMPLITUDE_RELEASE_KEY"
    sentry_dsn="SENTRY_DSN_KEY"
    ```

Then build project.

### IDE setup (optional) 

Based on your IDE setup, you might experience problems while accessing/importing auto-generated Kotlin classes from `protocol` module. These classes are currently declared in very large files, which IDE might not process as expected. If this is your case, go to your Android Studio _Help_ section, select _Edit Custom Properties_ option. There you should set `idea.max.intellisense.filesize` property as follows:

```
idea.max.intellisense.filesize=3500
```
