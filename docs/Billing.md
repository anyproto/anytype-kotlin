Classy Taxi: Google Play Billing Android App Kotlin Sample
=====================================================

This is the ClassyTaxi Kotlin Android app to buy subscriptions and one-time products.

Classy Taxi is an end-to-end project that highlights subscription and one-time product features on Google Play Billing,
such as Real-time Developer Notifications, account hold, grace period, and more. The code has 3
major components: an **Android app** to buy subscriptions and one-time products,
a **[Node.js server](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer)**
to manage subscriptions and one-time products, and a
read-only **[web client](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiAppWeb)**
to access the subscriptions on multiple platforms.

# Clone the sample project

    git clone https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples.git

# What do I need?

* A [Google Play Developer Account](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/) to publish
  the app and manage subscriptions and one-time products

* A [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) to deploy the server implementation on
  [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/), enable sign-in, and
  support Firebase Cloud Messaging

    * Note: The Firebase project has a corresponding Google Cloud Console project that will be
      configured for Real-time Developer Notifications

* A [Google Cloud Console project](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#linking_your_api_project)
to use the Google Play APIs

    * Note: This is usually a different Google Cloud Console project than the one used with Firebase

# Summary: What order should I do things?

1. Choose the **Android package name**

1. Start the **Firebase Project Setup**

    * Firebase setup requires that you know the Android package name

    * You can add the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint information to the Firebase console later

1. Complete the **Android App Setup**

    * The Android app will not build without `google-services.json` from Firebase

1. **Upload a release-build APK** signed with release keys to Google Play

    * To use Google Play Billing APIs you need an APK to published to a track on Google Play
      (internal testing, closed testing, open testing, or production track)

        * See [Set up an open, closed, or internal test](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213)

1. Complete the **Firebase Project Setup**

    * If you skipped the Firebase configuration step for the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint, you can
      complete that step now by rebuilding with the updated `google-services.json`
      
1. Start the **Play Developer Console Setup**

    * Google Play Billing APIs require the products to be configured in the console

1. Optional: Test with a debug APK and debug signatures on your device

    * Add your test Google account to the License Testing section of your Google Play Developer
      Account

        * For more information about one-time purchase, see [Test one-time products](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#one-time)

        * For more information about subscription, see [Test subscription-specific features](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing#subs)

    * **License Testing accounts can use the Google Play Billing APIs with debug builds and debug
      signatures as long as the package name matches the APK in the Play Store**

    * If the Google account is not enabled for License Testing, Google Play Billing APIs will only
      work if the app is installed by Google Play

        * **Sideloaded APKs will not work for users that are not enabled for License Testing**

1. Complete the **Play Developer Console Setup**

    * Link your Google Cloud Console project to the Google Play Developer Account

        * Note: A Google Play Console account can only be linked to a single Google Cloud Console
          project, so **we recommend creating a dedicated Google Cloud Console project that is shared by all apps in your Google Play Console**

        * Configure a service account in Google Cloud Console

1. **Deploy [Backend Server](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer)**

1. Complete **Real-time Developer Notifications Setup**

1. Complete the **Regenerate and re-upload App** step

# Firebase Project Setup

This sample application uses Firebase (Auth, Notifications, Firestore).

1. Go to [**Firebase Console**](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a Firebase project.
  See [Create a Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#create-firebase-project)

1. In the project, go to Build > Cloud Firestore > Create database > Start in **production mode**

1. In the project, go to Build > Functions> Get started. Enable Functions.

1. In the project, go to Build > Authentication > Get started > Sign-in method. Enable 
  **Email/Password** and **Google** as Sign-in providers

1. [Add your Android app to the Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#register-app) 

1. Add your app's SHA-1 fingerprint for Google Sign-In

    * Specify your app's SHA-1 fingerprint from
      the [Settings page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/)
      on Firebase console.

    * If you didn't input SHA-1 fingerprint for debug build during previous step, type 
      the following command from the project directory and add it to Firebase console:
       * Mac / Linux - `$ keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore`
       * Windows - `$ keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore %USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore`
      
    * If you are using Google Play Signing, you can get the SHA-1 fingerprint 
      on the Google Play Console under **Setup > App Integrity**.

    * See [Authenticating Your Client](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth)
      for details on how to get your app's SHA-1 fingerprint.

    * If you do not know your SHA-1 fingerprint yet, it's OK to skip it for now and return after you 
      have signed your APK later.


# Android App Setup

To use the Google Play Billing APIs, you must pick a unique package name and upload a
[signed release APK](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html) to Google Play.
The Android app will only build after you include a compatible `google-services.json` file from the
Firebase configuration

## Build your APK from Android Studio

1. Change the `androidApplicationId` to the correct Android package name

    * `{project_folder}/gradle.properties`

1. Confirm that you have the latest `google-services.json` from the Firebase configuration in your
   app directory

    * `{project_folder}/app/google-services.json`

1. Optional: If you want to test the UI without the Firebase server, change this variable in
   `Constants.kt`

    * `USE_FAKE_SERVER = true`

1. Remove the google-services.json configuration file located in the appâ€™s debug folder.

    * `{project_folder}/app/src/debug/`

1. Rebuild the Gradle project and make sure that there are no errors

1. [Sign a release build](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk) with 
   your release key

1. If you skipped the Firebase configuration step for the SHA-1 fingerprint, you can complete that
   step now, and rebuild with the updated `google-services.json`

    * If you are using Google Play Signing, you can get the SHA-1 on the Google Play Console under
      **Setup > App Integrity**

# Play Developer Console Setup

1. Create an application on [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/console)

2. Upload and publish the release App Bundle/APK to the Internal testing, Closed testing,
   Open testing, or Production track

    * See [Create and set up your app](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469).

3. [Create subscriptions](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/140504) and
   [one-time products](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1153481)
   for a basic subscription, premium subscription, and one-time product]

    * The Android app `Constants.kt` contains 3 products: `"basic_subscription"`,
       `"premium_subscription"`, and `"otp"`. `Constants.kt` also contains 6 base plan tags to showcase
      how subscription products can have multiple base plans.

    * Use the 2 subscription products as the Product ID when creating the subscription products and add the tags
    to the appropriate base plans(monthly and yearly auto-renewing base plans, and prepaid base plans).

    * Use the one-time product as the Product ID when creating the one-time products.

    * Write down your product IDs so you can configure your backend server.

5. [Link the Google Cloud project to the Google Play Developer Account](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#linking_your_api_project)

    * Use the Google Cloud Console project that corresponds to your Google Play Developer Account

    * Enable API access using a service account

        * See [Using a service account](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/getting_started#using_a_service_account)

    * Create a new private key for your service account, and download it in JSON format with the
      filename `service-account.json`

    * Copy `service-account.json` to the ClassyTaxiServer folder

        * `{project_folder}/ClassyTaxiServer/src/service-account.json`

    * Provide the necessary [**Account permission**](https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions) to the service account email
      address

        * **View financial data, orders, and cancellation survey responses**

        * **Manage orders and subscriptions**

        * **View app information and download bulk reports (read-only)**

6. Recommended: Create a license test account
   to [test subscriptions quickly](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/01/faster-renewals-for-test-subscriptions.html)
   without spending money

    * For more information, see [Test in-app billing with application licensing
](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6062777)

# Deploy Backend Server

Follow the [steps to deploy the backend server](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer)
* Note: Please take a note of the endpoint server URL/Function URL when your functions are
  successfully deployed--You will need it to fill in the settings on Google Cloud Platform Console and
  the app's `gradle.properties` file. It should be in this exampleâ€™s format:
  `https://{region_name}-{project_name}.cloudfunctions.net`

# Real-time Developer Notifications Setup

1. Use the Google Cloud Platform project that corresponds to the Firebase project to
   enable [Cloud PubSub](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub?tutorial=pubsub_quickstart&_ga=2.248010692.2130588993.1635461725-2065840594.1635461725)

    * For more information, see [Configure Real-time developer notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#configure-rtdn)

    * Name your Pub/Sub topic: `play-subs`

    * Add the Google Play service account to the topic:

      * In the Permissions section, click **Add Principal**. Set account to 
        `google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com` and grant the Role as
        **Pub/Sub Publisher**.

    * Copy the **Topic name** so that you can add it to the Google Play Console

    * Note: Make sure you created the topic in your Firebase project (not "Google Play Console Developer" project). And note that you don't need to **create subscription**, just use the one auto-generated by Firebase functions.

1. Configure the Google Play Console to allow your backend to receive notifications from Play Store
   for subscription purchase changes

    * See [Enable Real-time developer notifications for your app](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/getting-ready#enable-rtdn)

    * Your real-time developer notifications **Topic name** should be in this format

        * `projects/{your_firebase_project_id}/topics/play-subs`

    * Note: RTDN is available only for subscriptions for now on the server side in this sample.

# Regenerate and re-upload App

1. Open the app module build.gradle file

1. Update the **SERVER_URL** in the buildtype DSL object for the debug and release builds

```
buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
            buildConfigField("String", "SERVER_URL", "\"https://{region_name}-{project_name}.cloudfunctions.net\"")
        }
        debug {
            minifyEnabled false
            buildConfigField("String", "SERVER_URL", "\"https://{region_name}-{project_name}.cloudfunctions.net\"")
        }
    }
```

1. Re-generate a new app bundle and upload it to a new Play store release


# Troubleshoot common issues

* Q: There is a warning "*Billing account not configured. External network is not accessible and
  quotas are severely limited. Configure billing account to remove these restrictions*" in my Cloud
  Functions log.

    * A: You can safely ignore the warning and stay use the Firebase Spark Plan because the sample
      only accesses the Google network.

* Q: The logs on your server show an error: "*Unexpected error when querying Google Play Developer
  API. Please check if you use a correct service account*".

    * A: Check that the `service-account.json` that you deployed to your server matches the service
      account email that is registered in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/api-access)
      .

* Q: "*The current user has insufficient permissions to perform the requested operation.*"

    * A: Check that the service account email that is registered in the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions)
      has the necessary **Account permission**
        * **View financial data, orders, and cancellation survey responses**
        * **Manage orders and subscriptions**

* Q: Android
  build: `Execution failed for task :app:processDebugGoogleServices. File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it`.

    * A: Download `google-services.json` from the Firebase console.

* Q: Android
  build: `No matching client found for package name com.example.subscriptions.classytaxi'`.

    * A: Change the `androidApplicationId` in `gradle.properties` and download the updated
      `google-services.json` from your Firebase project configuration.

* Q: Real-time Developer Notifications are not working.

    * A: Make sure the Google Play service account has access as the **Publisher** so Google Play
      can publish updates to you.

* Q: Unable to upload the App Bundle to the Play store release with the error `Version code has already been used. Try another version code`

    * A: Update the `androidMobileVersionCode` in the `gradle.properties` file.

# Optional: Build the Android app from the command line

The sample allows you to specify signing keys and a package name with the Gradle command line. This
allows you to build and sign a release APK without making any modifications to the git repository.
The sample contains a file `example-keystore.properties` that you can copy (or modify) to meet your
needs.

1. Create a file `release-keystore.properties` with your release key information (see
   `example-keystore.properties` for the expected format)

    * See [Remove signing information from your build files](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#secure-shared-keystore)

1. Download the generated `google-services.json` and move it to your app module directory

    * `{project_folder}/app/google-services.json`

1. Run the following Gradle command in the directory `{project_folder}`

    * Replace the Android application ID with your unique package name

          ./gradlew -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties assembleRelease

1. Find the location of the output APK

       {project_folder}/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

1. Deploy this APK to your Internal Test track for fast development

    * See [Set up an open, closed, or internal test
](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213)

## Android files required for a release APK with release keys

* Keystore: `release.jks`
* Passwords: `release-keystore.properties`
* Firebase configuration: `google-services.json`

## Full list of commands to build a release APK

    cd {project_folder}

    ### Put release keystore information in the root project directory
    cp /path/to/your/secrets/release.jks .
    cp /path/to/your/secrets/release-keystore.properties .

    ### Put Firebase google-services.json in the `app/` directory
    cp /path/to/your/secrets/google-services.json ./app/google-services.json

    ### Check to make sure the files are in the correct location
    ls -1 *.jks *keystore.properties
    # debug.jks
    # keystore.properties
    # release-keystore.properties
    # release.jks

    ### Make sure you are not tracking any secret files in git
    git status
    # On branch master
    # nothing to commit, **working tree clean**

    ### Release build with release keys
    ./gradlew -PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package assembleRelease

    ### Debug build with release keys
    ./gradlew -PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package assembleDebug

    ### Specify version name and version code
    ./gradlew -PandroidMobileVersionName=1.0.1 -PandroidMobileVersionCode=2 -PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties -PandroidApplicationId=com.example.subscriptions.different.package assembleRelease

    ### Note: Release builds must be installed by Google Play.
    ### This means you must deploy release builds to a
    ### track on Google Play in order to use the Google Play Billing APIs.
    ### Use debug builds to sideload the app for testing.
    ### Android Studio creates debug builds by default.
    ### Gradle will create debug builds with the task `assembleDebug`.
